# Hospital-Performance-Utilization-Intelligence-System
A data-driven system providing insights on hospital operations, patient flow, and resource use to support efficient decision-making.


📌 Project Overview

The Healthcare Operations & Utilization Intelligence Dashboard is a data-driven analytics project designed to monitor hospital performance, patient utilization trends, and regional healthcare activity.

This dashboard transforms raw healthcare data into actionable insights to support operational efficiency, service optimization, and strategic decision-making across healthcare facilities.


📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Total Admissions: 48,620

Discharged Patients: 39,847 

Average Length of Stay: 4.5 days

Mortality Rate: 5.00%

Bed Occupancy Rate: 100.00%

These KPIs provide a high-level snapshot of hospital capacity, efficiency, and patient flow performance.
